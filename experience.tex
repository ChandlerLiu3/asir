                    \item {\em Responsibilities}:
                    I was responsible to coordinate EB experts, customers, and IT supports;
                    and integrate software modules into OSEK OS,
                    including CAN stack, IO driver, bootloader, and XCP.
                    \item {\em Description}:
                    The project was to build a hard realtime system
                    for automobile parking assistance
                    which needs to pay a lot of attention to memory and CPU efficience.
                    The system detects distance via sonar, reads information from automotive BUS network,
                    estimates risk and sends command to other ECUs, such as brake controller.
                    \item {\em Environment}:
                    Windows XP, OSEK OS, MPC5643L, CAN bus
